    The only significant change to net search is to make it possible to search
    by a specific set of coordination numbers

    thus p gives only p-coordinated nets

    p q gives only (p,q)-coordinated

    p q r gives nay (p,q,r)-coordinated.

    The other searches for layers and polyhedra are much simpler.

    The nets data re all in one text file called 3dall.txt unfortunately this
    wretched computer won't let me attach. Stu will have it. Instructions for
    parsing that file are in this message starting here:

    “start”

    serial number (has no significance)

    symbol (examples: srs, mgz-x-d-e)

    embed type (examples: 1a, 3b, unk)

    nos = number of other symbols followed by nos lines each having one “other
    symbol”

    nn = number of names followed by nn lines each having one “name”

    non = number of other names followed by non lines each having one “other
    name”

    nk = number of keywords followed by nk lines each having one “keyword”

    [[ +
      nr = number of references followed by nr lines each having one
      "reference"
    ]]

    space group symbol and space group number

    a b c alpha beta gamma (unit cell parameters)

    nv = number of kinds of vertex. [The next six lines are repeated nv times]

    vertex name   coordination number

    coordinates (x, y, z) numerical (should range from 0 to <1, four decimals)

    coordinates symbolic (this should be read as a character stream)

    wyckoff (this consists of a number and a letter. The number is needed as
    such)

    symmetry (character stream)

    order (number)

    ne number of kinds of edge. [The next five lines are repeated ne times]

    edge name coordination number (the coordination number is always 2 and is
    not used)

    coordinates (x, y, z) numerical (should range from 0 to <1, four decimals)

    coordinates symbolic (this should be read as a character stream)

    wyckoff (this consists of a number and a letter. The number is needed as
    such)

    symmetry (character stream)

    nf = number of kinds of face

    nt =  number of kinds of tile

    [[ +
      nch = number of chambers in the D-symbol for the tiling    
    ]]

    tiling (character stream)

    dual (character stream)

    [The next line nv times]

    cs1 cs 2cs 3 cs4 cs 5 cs 6 cs 7 cs 8 cs9 cs10 cum10 (integers)

    [The next line nv times]

    vertex symbol (character stream)

    smallest ring size (integer)

     

    Notes

    1. other symbols retrieve the appropriate structure if entered in the
    “symbol” search

    2. other names do not show but if an “other name” is entered in the name
    search the appropriate structure will be retrieved

    3. In the latest version the list of keywords is accumulated from this
    file

    4. The space group symbol is displayed on the page, but search is by space
    group number

    5. alpha, beta and gamma are usually (but not always) 90 or 120 inn which
    casethey should be displayed as 90.0 or 120.0 Ocassionally there is
    another value (see e.g. coe) in which case the value should be given to
    three decimals (this is not correctly implemented at present).

    6 each structure has a smallest coordination number (cnmin) and a largest
    coordination number (cnmax). Usually, but not always, they are the
    same. When searching by coordination number from p to q this means cnmin ≥
    p and cnmax ≤ q.

    Quantities not specified that must be calculated are “density”, “genus”,
    “volume”, “td10”, and “order” as used in the search. Details are given
    below.

    All the "bounds" in the search are positive numbers (integers except for
    density. The default lower bound is 0 the upper bound some big number say
    10^6.

    Four decimals for floating point numbers. Okay to drop trailing zeros if
    more than one decimal (90.0000 becomes 90.0, 0.1250 becomes 0.125).

    No capital letters except in "Wyckoff" and "D-symbol"

    if cnmax. > 6 no vertex symbol on page (see e.g. bcu) in input data is unk

    if nf = 0 there are no tiling data and the tiling part of the page is not
    displayed (see e.g. elv)

    2 

    Calculations

    If the unit cell parameters are a, b, c, al, be, ga, the volume is 

    V = abc√[1 + 2cos(al)cos(be)cos(ga) - cos2(al) - cos2(be) - cos2(ga)]

    For vertex i there are ni in the unit cell, where ni is given by the
    number part of the Wyckoff symbol for that vertex (a typical Wyckoff
    symbol is 16 g)

    the total number of vertices in the unit cell is N = ∑ ni (sum over all
    vertices)

    The density is N/V

    For edge i there are ei in the unit cell, where ei is given by the number
    part of the Wyckoff symbol for that edge

    the total number of edges in the unit cell is E = ∑ ei (sum over all
    edges)

    The multiplicity of the unit cell, m is given by the first letter in the
    space group symbol

    P, m = 1

    A, B, C, or I, m = 2

    R, m = 3

    F, m = 4

    genus = 1 + (E - N)/m

    Each vertex i has an order of symmetry oi. The order in the search is the
    average

    ∑ nioi/N (sum over all vertices). 

    Each vertex i has cum10 ci. The td10 in the search is the average

    ∑ nici/N (sum over all vertices) . Round off to integer.
