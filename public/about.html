    The most important part is a searchable database of 3-periodic nets. These
    are presented for the most part in maximum symmetry embeddings in which
    edge lengths are constrained to be equal to unity and the volume is
    maximized subject to that constraint. For these the "embed type" is
    1. Some nets do not allow such embeddings and other embeddability types
    are given below.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking the "nets" link leads to a search page where searches can be done
    by <i>symbol</i>(every structure in this database has a unique symbol),
    by <i>name</i> (some structures have names) by <i>keyword</i> and
    by <i>properties</i>. The terms are all explained in popups accessed by
    clicking the appropriate link on the search page. As well as
    crystallographic data, vertex symbols and coordination sequences are
    given. For an explanation of these see reference [1] below. Tilings are
    generally given as natural tilings [2] with face symbols
    [<i>N<sup>n</sup></i>.<i>M<sup>m</sup></i>...] that indicate that the tile
    has <i>n N-</i>sided faces, <i>m M</i>-sided faces etc. For other terms
    see the popups on the search page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other databases are of 2-periodic structures ("layers") and of
    "polyhedra". At present we have a fewer entries for these. Users familiar
    with the "nets" search should find these self-explanatory, but read on
    after "embeddings" on how to use the coordinate data for polyhedra and
    some other notes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The symbol is either a three-letter symbol <b>pqr</b> or a three letter
    symbol with an extension as in <b>pqr-a</b>. It is not necessary to know
    the meanings of the extensions but it can be useful and clicking on the
    "symbol" on the "nets" search page will provide an explanation of the
    extensions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Much of the data (structures with embed type not 1) have been entered by
    hand, so there doubtless errors, please let us know if you identify
    any.
  </p>

  <p>
    The structures are nets (special kinds of graphs) and to use the data one
    needs to know the edges ("bonds"). For "embed type" 1 (most of the data)
    the shortest distances are the edges. For other structures it is generally
    sufficient to put a vertex of valence 2 at the midpoints of the edges
    (these data are given). Structures where this won't work (one has to
    explicitly use the symmetry) include <b>elv</b>, <b>mab</b>, <b>tcb</b>,
    <b>tcc</b>, <b>ten</b>.

  <h2>
    Embeddings of nets <sup>[10]</sup>
  </h2>

  <p>
    Usually in describing a net, parameters are given appropriate to a
    maximum-symmetry embedding. Ideally also the shortest distances are all
    equal (for convenience unity in the units of the lattice parameters) and
    correspond to the edges of the net. This ideal situation is not always
    possible however, as can seen by considering a generic infinite net
    without symmetry. Let the average coordination number be <i>Z</i>, then
    there are <i>Z</i>/2 edges per vertex.  Each vertex has three coordinates
    (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>), so if <i>Z</i> &gt; 6 there are more
    constraints (edge lengths) than degrees of freedom (coordinates) and there
    is no solution for equal edges possible. In fact, as the equations for
    edge lengths are non-linear in coordinates, there is no guarantee that
    there is a solution even for <i>Z</i> &lt;= 6. Of course we are not
    dealing with generic structures, but rather with translational and,
    usually, other symmetries, so the problem is quite complicated. There are
    several cases to consider:
  </p>

  <ol type="1">
    <li>
      For the simple nets most common in crystal chemistry the
      maximum symmetry embedding is a sphere packing. There are three
      cases:

      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          The coordinates and unit cell shape are fixed by symmetry in the
          maximum-symmetry embedding.
        </li>

        <li>
          In other cases there are still degrees of freedom remaining. It is
          common in this case to report a structure that is a minimum of density
          (maximum cell volume) subject to the constraint of equal edge lengths
          which can be taken as unity.
        </li>

        <li>
          Again there are free parameters, but the minimum density configuration
          corresponds to a structure with more contacts.  This is almost the
          same as 2a (not exactly as minimum density may not be maximum
          symmetry)
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      The maximum symmetry embedding corresponds to a sphere packing with more
      contacts than the coordination number, <i>n</i>, but <i>n</i> of those
      contacts correspond to edges; there are two cases:

      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          There is an embedding as an <i>n</i>-coordinated sphere packing of
          lower symmetry in which the <i>n</i> edges correspond to edges.
        </li>

        <li>
          There is not an embedding as above (strictly we should say that such
          an embedding cannot be found, <i>proving</i> one does not exist
          might be difficult). This case is more common than might be
          supposed.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      The maximum symmetry embedding is a sphere packing with fewer contacts
      than the coordination number, <i>n</i>; but the <i>n</i> shortest
      distances correspond to the edges of the <i>n</i>-coordinated net; there
      are three cases:

      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          There is a lower-symmetry embedding with equal edge lengths and
          edges still corresponding to shortest distances between
          vertices.
        </li>

        <li>
          There is no embedding with equal edge lengths.
        </li>

        <li>
          There is an embedding with shortest distances equal to edges, but
          they cannot all be made equal and remain shortest
          distances.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      There may be no embedding with shortest distances corresponding to
      edges. This is in fact the case for the vast majority of nets. Until
      recently they were not recognized in crystal chemistry, as normally
      bonds (corresponding to edges of nets) are formed to nearest neighbors,
      but, with flexible linkers instead of bonds as the edges of nets, they
      are beginning to appear (see e.g. <b>tcb</b>). Most catenated nets (see
      e.g. <b>pcu-c</b>) are like this.
    </li>

    <li>
      There may be no faithful embedding in the maximum symmetry conformation
      because the symmetry will require edges to intersect. There is always a
      lower-symmetry embedding - all graphs have a faithful embedding in
      3-dimensional Euclidean space. These lower symmetry embeddings may be
      any one of the types described above in 1-4, (but of course not of
      maximum symmetry) and there may be several equally "good". These
      structures can be recognized by the fact that: (a) They have
      symbol <b>abc-z</b> and there is no entry <b>abc</b>. (b) They have
      embed type 5. The maximum symmetry for these nets is given in the same
      box as the embed type.
    </li>
  </ol>

    <p><span class='c7'>Collisions</span></p>

    <p><span class='c8'>In computing
    properties of nets, for example in the program
    <b>Systre</b></span><span class='c8'>, it is convenient to use
    center-of-mass (barycentric) coordinates (all vertices assigned
    the same mass - see reference [4]). For some exceptional
    structures one may find that two vertices then have identical
    coordinates. Such structures are identified by an asterisk in
    embed type (e.g. *1b). <b>Systre</b></span> <span class=
    'c8'>won't recognize these structures.
    <b>Systre</b></span><span class='c8'>can be obtained from
    gavrog.org.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c7'>Density</span></p>

    <p><span class='c8'>The density is the
    number of vertices per unit volume for the given embedding. For
    structures of embed, type 1 or 2 (all edges of equal length and
    no shorter intervertex distance shorter) on can calculate the
    space-filling fraction of equal spheres in contact for that
    structure by multiplying the density by pi/6.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c7'>Genus</span></p>

    <p><span class='c8'>A net can be
    considered a periodic surface of genus <i>g</i></span>
    <span class='c8'>if one imagines the edges inflated to have
    finite width. If there are <i>e</i></span> <span class=
    'c8'>edges and <i>v</i></span> <span class='c8'>vertices in the
    primitive cell then <i>g</i></span> <span class='c8'>= 1 +
    <i>e</i></span> <span class='c8'>-<i>v</i></span><span class=
    'c8'>. See the pop-up for 'density' on the search
    page.</span></p>

    <p><span class=
    'c8'><![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]></span></p>

    <p><span class='c7'>Tiling data</span></p>

    <p><span class='c8'>Data for tilings are
    for the so-called "natural" tilings (reference [2] and [13]).
    The D-symbols are what were originally called "Delaney" symbols
    by Dress and "Delaney-Dress" symbols by subsequent workers. The
    economical one-line encoding is due to Delgado-Friedrichs so
    "D-symbol" seems appropriate. The size of the D-symbol is what
    is known as "flag transitivity" to mathematicians. One may use
    the search to find the only regular tiling (D-symbol size = 1)
    and all natural tilings with size up to 4. Regular
    <i>nets</i></span> <span class='c9'>are defined independently
    of tilings but are the only structures with natural tilings
    that have one kind of vertex, edge, face and tile (transitivity
    1111 - see reference [2]).</span></p>

    <p><span class='c8'>Most of the tiling
    data come from TOPOS (see "links") and were prepared by Maxim
    Peskov.</span></p>

    <p><span class=
    'c8'><![if !supportEmptyParas]> <![endif]></span></p>

    <p><span class='c7'>Layers and
    polyhedra</span></p>

    <p><span class='c18'>Layers</span>
    <span class='c8'>are three dimensional 2-periodic structures
    and their symmetries are layer groups. Strictly 2-dimensional
    2-periodic structures have symmetries that are plane groups.
    Structures that are not 2-dimensional have the keyword "layer"
    We give also a 3-dimensional space group which can be used for
    entering the structure in a crystal-drawing program such as
    CrystalMaker. Where possible, coordinates are given for unit
    edge length.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c8'>Notice that for
    2-dimensional structures, vertex symbols denote the polygons
    meeting at that vertex in cyclic order (compare 3^3.4^2 and
    3^2.4.3.4); for layers vertex symbols are the same as for
    nets.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c8'>See reference [12]
    below for an account of plane nets in crystal chemistry. For
    nets named OKHnn, nn is the net number of that work.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c18'>Polyhedra</span>
    <span class='c8'>are 0-periodic, but of course 3-dimensional.
    We use the term to include generalized polyhedra ("cages") such
    as the adamantane cage (see <b>ada</b></span><span class=
    'c8'>). The coordinates of the vertices are cartesian
    coordinates but can be used with the given space group to again
    draw as if it were part of a crystal structure. To do this set
    the unit cell of the given space group to <i>d</i></span>
    <span class='c18'>d d</span><span class='c8'>90.0 90.0 90.0
    with <i>d</i></span> <span class='c8'>some convenient number
    (say 10.0) and divide the given coordinates by <i>d</i></span>
    <span class='c8'>and use them as crystal coordinates. One will
    then get the polyhedron centered on 0, 0, 0.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c8'>Notice that for
    polyhedra with non-crystallographic symmetries more than one
    set of coordinates may be given for a single vertex type - see
    e.g. <b>dod</b></span> <span class='c8'>with icosahedral
    symmetry but described with <i>m</i></span><span class='c8'>-3
    symmetry - the single vertex type splits into V1a and V1b.
    Hexagonal polyhedra are described using an orthorhombic space
    group - see e.g. <b>hxb</b></span><span class='c8'>. A square
    antiprism is another example of a polyhedron with
    non-crystallographic symmetry - see
    <b>sap</b></span><span class='c8'>.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c8'>For convenience the
    coordinates of the centers of faces are also given.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c8'>In the strict
    definition adopted by many mathematicians
    <i>polyhedra</i></span> <span class='c8'>have a planar
    3-connected graph and can be realized as a strictly convex
    solid. We refer to structures that do not have this property as
    <i>cages</i></span> <span class='c8'>for the purpose of the
    database (generally elsewhere the term "cage" includes
    polyhedra as in "sodalite cage" or "faujasite cage", but these
    structures are polyhedra <i>sensu
    stricto</i></span><span class='c8'>).</span></p>

    <p><span class='c8'>Notice that generally
    we give vertices for equal edge; some polyhedra do not then
    have planar faces (see e.g. the faujasite cage
    <b>fac</b></span> <span class='c8'>which is given as it appears
    in the crystal structure). For
    <i>Archimedean</i></span><span class='c8'>polyhedra (one kind
    of vertex) and the full symmetry the requirement of equal edges
    uniquely defines the embedding; for their duals
    (<i>Catalan</i></span> <span class='c8'>polyhedra with one kind
    of face) there are generally more degrees of freedom and there
    appears to be no definitive embedding agreed upon - the most
    pleasing have unequal edges. [Exceptions are <b>rdo</b></span>
    <span class='c8'>and <b>trc</b></span> <span class='c9'>which
    are the duals of the two quasiregular (one kind of edge)
    Archimedean polyhedra <b>cbo</b></span> <span class='c8'>and
    <b>ido</b></span><span class='c8'>]</span></p>

    <p><span class='c18'>Simple</span>
    <span class='c8'>polyhedra have exactly three faces meeting at
    a vertex; <i>simplicial</i></span><span class='c8'>polyhedra
    have all triangular faces. The dual of a simple polyhedron is
    simplicial and <i>vice versa</i></span><span class=
