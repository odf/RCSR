      The basic structures have a three-letter code e.g. <b>srs</b> for the
      SrSi</span><span class="T2">2</span><span class="T1"> net and <b>dia</b>
      for the diamond net.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some derived structures are
      designated thus (see below for
      definitions)

      augmented net is one in which the vertices of the original net are
      replaced by a polygon or polyhedron corresponding to the original
      coordination figure. The net (<b>cab</b>) named for CaB6 is the
      augmented primitive cubic (<b>pcu</b>) net and can also be found using
      the symbol <b>pcu-a</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      binary net is one derived from a uninodal net with even rings by
      alternating vertices AB such that A is bonded only to B and vice
      versa. The sphalerite structure of ZnS is the binary version of diamond
      (<b>dia-b</b>). A binodal net can have on kind of vertex colred as
      in <b>tbo-b </b>or even ne kind of node three-colored as
      in <b>tbo-b3</b>. Yet another possibility is that a uninodal may have
      the nodes split into unequal parts as in <b>srs‑b*</b> in which ¼ of the
      nodes are one color and ¾ another color (thenet is no longer bipartite
      now).
    </p>

    <p>
      catenated net refers to a pair of self-dual nets (such as diamond)
      intergrown. Notice that the symmetry of the pair is different from that
      of just one. Multiple
      (</span><span class="T4">n</span><span class="T1">-fold) catenations are
      indicated by extension <b>‑cn</b>. There may be two different
      catenations of the same mltiplicity as in <b>dia-c3</b>
      and <b>dia-c3#*</b>.</span></p>

  <p class="P1"><span class="T3">dual
      net</span><span class="T1"> is the net of the tiling dual the natural
      tiling of the first net. This is the same net in the case of self-dual
      nets. E.g. <b>dia-d</b>
      = <b>dia</b>.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T3">edge
      net </span><span class="T1">(also expanded net) is obtained from the
      original net by placing vertices in the middle of the edges, discarding
      the original vertices and edges, and joining the new vertices to enclose
      the coordination figure of the original
      vertices.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T3">decorated
      nets</span><span class="T1"> are obtained by replacing the vertices of
      the original net by groups of vertices. Augmented nets are special cases
      of decorated nets. (To see examples
      enter <b>bcu</b>.)</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T3">extended
      coordination </span><span class="T1">Occasionally one want to consider
      other than </span><span class="T1">nearest neighbors in the coordination
      shell. An example is provided by the body-centered cubic lattice. Each
      vertex has eight first neighbors and 6 second neighbors. The
      structure <b>bcu</b> is eight-coordinated and is the dual
      of <b>nbo</b>. <b>bcu-x</b> is 14-coordinated and is the dual
      of <b>sod</b>. [<b>bcu-x</b> is the structure corresponding to a vertex-
      and tile-transitive tiling of space by
      tetrahedra.</span></p>

<p class="P1"><span class="T3">alternative
      configuration</span><span class="T1"> Sometimes an configuration other
      than the maximum volume is of interest. See for example the
      configuration (<b>ths-z</b>) of the 3-coordinated <b>ths</b> net with
      the three edges meeting at a vertex forming a T shape. In nets such
      as <b>sld-z</b> and <b>rld-z</b> in the maximum symmetry configuration
      two or more vertices occupy the same site. For such nets the embed type
      is given a 5 followed by the symbol for the maximum-symmetry space
      group.</span></p>
